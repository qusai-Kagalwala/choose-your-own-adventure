## 💻 Code Explanation

The game is built with several key Python concepts:

1. **Functions**: Organized into distinct scenarios and utility functions
2. **User Input**: Validated through custom functions to prevent errors
3. **Randomization**: Used for some outcomes to add replayability
4. **Text Effects**: Implemented with time delays for a better reading experience
5. **Error Handling**: Ensures the game doesn't crash on invalid inputs
6. **Screen Management**: Clears the console for a cleaner interface

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Character attributes (strength, intelligence, etc.)
- Inventory system for collecting and using items
- Health points and combat system
- Saving and loading game progress
- ASCII art for key scenes
